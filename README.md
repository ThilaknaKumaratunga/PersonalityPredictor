## Introvert vs Extrovert Classifier

This project builds and deploys a machine learning model to predict whether a person is an **introvert** or an **extrovert** based on their behavioral and social characteristics.

### 📂 Deliverables

* ✅ Trained ML model on the provided dataset
* ✅ Deployed API (public endpoint)
* ✅ Jupyter Notebook (`train.ipynb`) with data preparation, training, and evaluation
* ✅ Documentation of results

### 🚀 Model Performance
* **Test Accuracy:** 0.91
* **Recall:** 0.94
* **Precision:** 0.91


### 📊 Feature Importance (Key Insights)

* **Stage_fear** is the dominant feature (~96% importance).
* Minor contributions from **Post_frequency** and **Time_spent_Alone**.
* Interpretation: People with strong stage fear are far more likely to be introverts.

### 🌐 API Usage

The model is deployed as a REST API.
